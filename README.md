# -100daysofmiva
A repository documenting my progress through the #100DaysOfMiva coding challenge. Each day, I’ll work on different projects and concepts to improve my software engineering skills, covering topics like algorithms, web development, and more. Follow along as I grow and learn!

# 100 Days of Miva 🚀

Welcome to my #100DaysOfMiva repository! This journey is all about learning, building, and exploring various aspects of software development. This repository will contain multiple projects organized into different folders as I progress through the 100 days.

## Repository Structure 🗂️

Here's a quick guide on how to navigate through the folders:

### 1. **Vanillas** 🍦
Projects using **vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. No frameworks, just raw code.

📂 [Vanillas](./Vanillas)

### 2. **Django** 🐍
Projects built using the **Django framework**. Expect some cool full-stack stuff in here!

📂 [Django](./Django)

### 3. **Hybrids** ⚙️
Projects where I've combined two or more frameworks. Think of Django and React or any crazy combos!

📂 [Hybrids](./Hybrids)

### 4. **APIs** 🌐
Projects focused on building **RESTful APIs** with Django or Flask, and sometimes consuming APIs.

📂 [APIs](./APIs)

### 5. **FrontendMasters** 🎨
Advanced frontend development projects using **React**, **Vue**, or just plain **JavaScript** with some flair!

📂 [FrontendMasters](./FrontendMasters)

### 6. **FullstackFusion** 🌍
Full-stack applications that combine both frontend and backend. These are where everything comes together!

📂 [FullstackFusion](./FullstackFusion)

### 7. **Experiments** 🔬
A sandbox for testing and experimenting with new ideas, technologies, and frameworks.

📂 [Experiments](./Experiments)

### 8. **Challenges** 🏆
Code challenges, algorithms, and problems I’ve solved from platforms like **CodeWars** and **LeetCode**.
